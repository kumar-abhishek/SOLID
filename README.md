Software Design
==============

The design principles are associated to Robert Martin who gathered them in "Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices". 


[Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/victorakamon/SOLID/tree/master/src/dip) - srp

```
A class should have only one reason to change.
```

[Open Close Principle](https://github.com/victorakamon/SOLID/tree/master/src/isp) - ocp

```
Software entities like classes, modules and functions should be open for extension but closed for modifications.
```

[Liskov's Substitution Principle](https://github.com/victorakamon/SOLID/tree/master/src/lsp) - lsp

```
Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types.
```

[Interface Segregation Principle](https://github.com/victorakamon/SOLID/tree/master/src/ocp) - isp

```
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use.
```

[Dependency Inversion Principle](https://github.com/victorakamon/SOLID/tree/master/src/srp) - dip

```
* High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
* Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
```
