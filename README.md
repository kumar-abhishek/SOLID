Software Design
==============

The design principles are associated to Robert Martin who gathered them in "Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices". 


Single Responsibility Principle - srp

```
A class should have only one reason to change.
```

Open Close Principle - ocp

```
Software entities like classes, modules and functions should be open for extension but closed for modifications.
```

Liskov's Substitution Principle - lsp

```
Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types.
```

Interface Segregation Principle - isp

```
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use.
```

Dependency Inversion Principle - dip

```
* High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
* Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
```
